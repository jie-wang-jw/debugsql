# Databao Demo Development Notes

This file is a working memory note for local development in this starter-kit clone.
It is not part of the official submission package. Function-level provenance for local helper
layers is tracked in `README.function-ledger.md`.

## Local Setup

- Repository: `D:\Data\kddcup2026-data-agents-starter-kit`
- Public demo data: `data/public/input` and `data/public/output`
- Local config: `configs/react_baseline.local.yaml`

Use this cache workaround before `uv` commands on this machine:

```powershell
$env:Path = "C:\Users\tianj\.local\bin;$env:Path"
$env:UV_CACHE_DIR = "D:\Data\.uv-cache"
```

OpenRouter testing uses environment variables only. Do not write secrets into files:

```powershell
$env:MODEL_API_URL = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
$env:MODEL_API_KEY = $env:Open_Router_Key
$env:MODEL_NAME = "qwen/qwen3.5-35b-a3b"
```

## Current Runner Shape

`src/data_agent_baseline/run/databao_demo.py` keeps the original ReAct baseline separate and adds a
Databao-backed, adapter-level data-agent workflow.

The current execution flow is:

1. Load `task.json` and `context/`.
2. Load CSV, JSON, SQLite, and generic markdown records into `ContextTable` objects.
3. Build a schema graph with table profiles, column samples, and join candidates.
4. Run `query_context_retriever()` to score relevant tables, columns, samples, snippets, and join
   paths. Retrieval is diagnostic soft priority, not access control: Databao still receives
   registered structured sources.
5. Infer an `AnswerContract` from the question and schema.
6. Run Databao first. As soon as Databao returns any DataFrame, write a raw provisional
   `prediction.csv` before postprocess, ranking, verifier, or final guard work can fail.
7. Generate only low-risk adapter candidates: deterministic postprocess and row-preserving
   column-only compaction. Semantic verifier/repair candidates are not connected to the active
   runner.
8. Validate and rank candidates with a generic evaluator.
9. Apply `final_answer_shape_guard()` again before the final CSV write.
10. Write diagnostics, candidate scores, selected route, scorable status, timings, and safe ablation
   metadata.

Question parsing is now a signal layer rather than a decision layer. `extract_question_features()`
collects evidence such as aggregation, ratio/percentage, list/entity, multi-attribute, entity-plus-
metric, and superlative signals. Weak words such as `number`, `rate`, `value`, and `view count` only
gain real confidence when schema columns support them. `AnswerContract`, candidate ranking, and
cheap fallback decisions combine these question signals with schema evidence and candidate evidence
instead of letting a single regex change row or column limits.
List/entity and entity-plus-metric signals do not by themselves fix `max_columns`; column limits are
set only when requested columns can be inferred from question/schema evidence. If evidence is weak,
the contract stays open and the final guard only removes metadata/debug and safe helper columns.

This is intentionally not a benchmark-memory path. The runner no longer keeps production parsers or
routes for concrete public-set domains, entity names, category values, file stems, or task ids.
The only heuristic modes are:

- `DATABAO_HEURISTIC_LEVEL=generic` (default): generic loaders, schema graph, document records,
  answer contracts, verifiers, candidate ranking, and final shape guard.
- `DATABAO_HEURISTIC_LEVEL=experimental_generic`: allows slightly more aggressive generic
  paragraph extraction for records without explicit ids. It still must remain domain-agnostic.

## Candidate Workflow

Databao is treated as a black-box candidate generator. The adapter layer controls context,
validation, fallback, ranking, and output shape:

- `databao_raw`: the raw DataFrame returned by Databao.
- `databao_raw_postprocessed`: a deterministic repair candidate when generic postprocessing changes
  the raw DataFrame.
- `*_column_compact`: a conservative column-only cleanup candidate. It preserves all rows and only
  removes empty columns, duplicate-value columns, or constant display helper columns when another
  answer-like column remains.
- `cheap_count_fallback`: a low-confidence missing-prediction fallback used only after Databao
  failure when the question explicitly asks for plain row/record/entry count and a single
  high-confidence table can be selected. It is skipped for unexecuted filters, grouping, distinct,
  per/by/for clauses, temporal constraints, or other conditions.
- semantic verifier/repair candidates: generic superlative, context superlative, aggregate/ratio
  checks, ratio-scale compaction, and salvaged percentage/ratio repairs are disconnected from the
  active runner. This is a deliberate de-overfitting move: those candidates can boost known public
  failures but can also act like public-shape repair on hidden hard tasks. Future semantic repairs
  should be implemented inside Databao's tool/result loop when they are genuinely generic.

`succeeded` means the internal pipeline completed; `scorable` means a `prediction.csv` exists for
the evaluator. These are intentionally separate. Timeout and exception artifacts now inspect the
task output directory and preserve any provisional prediction that was already written.
The process wrapper returns a queued artifact as soon as the child reports one; lingering model
client/background threads may then be terminated without rewriting the task log as a timeout.

A Databao DataFrame is no longer considered fully correct by itself, but it is good enough to write
a raw provisional prediction immediately. Ordinary extra rows/columns are handled by cheap repair,
ranking, and the final shape guard. The planner is not started for ordinary suspicious output, and
it is not used as missing-prediction recovery in the default path.

Answer contracts should avoid over-scalarizing. Plain `what`, `which`, or `who` questions are not
single-row requests by themselves. Row limiting is reserved for scalar metrics or explicit top-one
language such as single/only/top-one/first-row/last-row/superlative wording. List/table contracts
preserve all candidate rows and only prune columns when the contract has explicit schema-backed
column evidence.

Display/entity resolution is generic and schema-driven. Entity answers prefer display/name/title/
label/url/link/text/value columns; id-like and `link_to_*` columns are treated as join helpers unless
the question explicitly asks for an id, identifier, code, or reference. URL/link questions prefer
URL-like columns over ids or numeric helper columns.

Identifier suppression now covers `id`, `*_id`, `link_to_*`, camelCase `*Id`, `identifier`, `code`,
and `reference`. If a final candidate exposes one of these columns and the question did not ask for
an identifier, postprocess tries to resolve it through context tables to a display column. If display
columns are already present, the final guard removes ID helper columns before writing CSV.

The ranker favors candidates with evidence: contract validity, schema-matched columns, retrieved
columns, display/id resolution, explicit aggregation components, and transformations that actually
performed the operation implied by the question. It no longer treats smaller row count as inherently
better when the answer contract allows multiple rows; list-like questions receive a bonus for
multi-row candidates. It penalizes debug metadata, answer-shape mismatch, empty required answers,
invalid frames, raw-table explosions, and weak verifier candidates without clear evidence. Count
questions penalize non-count-like output columns. Ratio/percentage verifier candidates require
explicit numerator and denominator components and are not emitted for zero/undefined percentages.
High-risk verifier candidates are deliberately discounted and no longer get a generic aggregation
bonus. In the current default path they are not generated at all; the scoring logic is retained only
for old-run diagnostics and explicit semantic-candidate ablations.

Questions that ask for an entity plus a metric, such as a display/name answer with a total, cost,
average, count, score, or value, use a multi-attribute contract. The final guard preserves display
and metric columns for these answers instead of shrinking them to a single scalar column.

## Submission Profiles

The default profile remains the local public high-score path. A separate hidden-set generalization
profile can be enabled with `DATABAO_GENERALIZATION_PROFILE=1`. It deliberately changes only three
high-risk public-fit surfaces:

- Prompt policy: keep the output contract, but remove proactive documentation-mapping and
  ratio/percentage query-shaping bullets.
- Databao internal P0 gates: keep only `empty_submit_result` as a forced reject; numeric grounding,
  blank-display, and time-granularity critiques remain diagnostic/shadow signals.
- Adapter answer-column verifier: prune columns only when the selected column(s) have strong
  question/column evidence. The final guard is otherwise unchanged.

This profile is for online A/B submission when local public accuracy appears overfit to the 49 known
tasks. It is not enabled by default and should be evaluated separately from the public high-score
profile.

Local public ablation on 2026-05-18 with `DATABAO_GENERALIZATION_PROFILE=1`,
`--task-timeout-seconds 600`, and `--max-workers 4`:

- easy `20260518T125747Z`: avg `0.733`, exact `11/15`, prediction `15/15`.
- medium `20260518T125944Z`: avg `0.558`, exact `12/23`, prediction `23/23`.
- hard `20260518T130233Z`: avg `0.379`, exact `3/11`, prediction `11/11`.

Interpretation: this is not a public-score replacement for the default path. It trades away known
easy/medium shape wins while improving hard prediction stability and local hard average, so it is
useful only as a hidden-set A/B profile.

### Finality Salvage Profile

`DATABAO_FINALITY_SALVAGE_PROFILE=1` is a smaller Databao-internal A/B profile for the remaining
submission attempts. It does not change the adapter, prompt, ranking, or final guard. Instead it
keeps the normal no-submit finality retry but makes the Databao feedback more conservative:

- no-submit finality retry defaults to two attempts unless
  `DATABAO_INTERNAL_NO_SUBMIT_FINALITY_MAX_RETRIES` is explicitly set;
- feedback tells Databao to prefer submitting a plausible latest non-empty query result rather than
  restarting broad exploration.

It intentionally does not soften P0 submit rejection. That behavior is split into
`DATABAO_SOFT_P0_PROFILE=1`, which narrows forced P0 rejection to `empty_submit_result`. Keep the
soft-P0 profile off unless intentionally running a high-risk generalization submission; local
ablation showed that softening P0 fixed missing predictions but also allowed too many wrong
intermediate submits through.

This is meant to test whether hidden hard tasks benefit from “submit the useful intermediate result”
behavior without reintroducing adapter-side public-shape repair.

## Context And Documents

The document ingestion layer is split:

- `document_records_for_reasoning()`: keeps full extraction metadata for diagnostics, verifier
  support, and log review.
- `document_records_for_agent()`: exposes only answer-safe columns to Databao.

Metadata/debug columns such as source document, evidence span, confidence, extraction strategy, and
paragraph index are never registered as ordinary Databao answer columns. They may appear in logs but
are removed by the final answer guard before CSV write.

`query_context_retriever()` is generic. It scores table names, column aliases, identifiers, display
columns, numeric metric columns, document record text, and join candidates. It does not select
context by file stem or domain name, and it does not hide unretrieved tables from Databao.

## Runner Baseline

The active runner is now a smaller Databao-first baseline. It loads context, asks Databao, writes a
raw provisional `prediction.csv` as soon as a DataFrame exists, then runs postprocess, candidate
ranking, final guard, diagnostics, and local evaluation metadata. LLM structured planner fallback,
LLM finalizer, semantic repair, schema hint, context budget, extra candidate generators, and failed
ablation switches are no longer connected to the main runner.

Timeout controls:

- `run-databao-demo --task-timeout-seconds N` sets a per-task process timeout.
- `DATABAO_DATABAO_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` controls the Databao/LangChain model timeout, default `100`.
  The effective Databao timeout is also capped dynamically at `remaining_task_seconds - 20`.

Timeout diagnostics preserve any already-written provisional CSV. Timeout logs include the latest
task progress payload under `timeout_budget.active_progress`, so missing-prediction tasks can be
triaged by active stage before changing model or context budgets.
Progress checkpoints now include `databao_frame_received`, `raw_provisional_csv_write`, and
`artifact_ready`, which separates model latency, CSV write failures, and child-process teardown.
Progress files also retain prior checkpoints, so timeout artifacts can still show `context_loaded`
payload data even when the latest active stage is Databao model execution.

## Removed Experiments

The failed role-evidence and generator experiments showed that generic-looking signals can still
become benchmark-shape overfitting if they drive both ranking and final-guard pruning. The mainline
runner therefore does not keep default-off experimental branches.

Removed from the active runner:

- LLM structured planner fallback and CLI `--planner-mode`.
- LLM finalizer and CLI `--finalizer-mode`.
- Semantic repair candidate flow.
- Schema/context prompt hint mode.
- Context budget compact mode.
- `DABENCH_CANDIDATE_GENERATORS`, including the LlamaIndex PandasQueryEngine adapter and temporary
  SQLite SQL generator.
- `DATABAO_LIGHTWEIGHT_RETRY`.
- `DATABAO_SAFE_POSTPROCESS_BONUS`.
- The old `DATABAO_RATIO_COMPACT_EXPERIMENT` switch. A narrower always-on
  `ratio_scale_compaction` candidate now exists only for already-computed component tables with
  complete numerator/denominator/result evidence.

Relevant baseline and negative-run notes:

- `20260509T132426Z` easy baseline: avg `0.711`, exact `10/15`, prediction `15/15`.
- `20260509T132904Z` medium baseline: avg `0.514`, exact `11/23`, prediction `23/23`.
- `20260509T134042Z` hard baseline: avg `0.273`, exact `3/11`, prediction `9/11`.
- `20260509T140121Z` hard lightweight-retry ablation: avg `0.152`, exact `1/11`,
  prediction `9/11`; removed instead of promoting.
- `20260510T150051Z`, `20260510T150514Z`, `20260510T151642Z` semantic-repair-off control:
  easy avg `0.700`, exact `10/15`, prediction `15/15`; medium avg `0.641`, exact `14/23`,
  prediction `22/23`; hard avg `0.212`, exact `2/11`, prediction `7/11`.
- Semantic repair v2 targeted safe check did not pass. Strong evidence helped `task_145` and
  `task_214`, but still selected wrong strong candidates for `task_25`, `task_243`, and `task_344`.
  Full safe sweep was skipped; semantic repair is now disconnected from the active runner and should
  not be promoted without a substantially narrower evidence model.
- Context budget compact targeted checks fixed some missing-prediction cases
  (`task_352`, `task_355`, `task_396`, and a later `task_420` run produced predictions), but full
  hard run `20260510T160349Z` regressed to avg `0.091`, exact `0/11`, prediction `8/11`; the switch
  has been removed from the active runner.
- Medium semantic-shape targeted checks: generic comment/text answer targeting fixed `task_259`
  (`20260510T162341Z` and `20260510T162938Z` exact). ID/display resolver changes did not reliably
  fix `task_257` because Databao returned semantically wrong source rows in later runs. Treat
  comment/text targeting as useful; do not infer broader semantic repair from it.
- Schema/context prompt hint targeted checks are mixed and remain off by default. The first enhanced
  pass improved explicit output-shape cases such as `task_250` in one run but failed most broader
  medium targets. A later `task_259` check showed that feeding `AnswerContract.expected_columns`
  into the Databao prompt can mislead the model toward filter/sort columns; enhanced hints now show
  only soft answer shape plus schema/question matched potential answer columns. `task_259`
  recovered to exact in run `20260511T003620Z`, while `task_250` later hit Databao
  `GraphRecursionError` with no prediction in `20260511T003720Z`. The broad switch has been removed;
  future prompt/context work should restart as a smaller targeted experiment.

- Post-cleanup hard diagnostics:
  - `20260511T052829Z` targeted `task_349` succeeded and wrote a prediction, but evaluator score was
    still `0.0`; this is a semantic-source issue, not a missing-file issue.
  - `20260511T053424Z` targeted `task_420` with a 100s task timeout still produced no prediction.
    The timeout log preserved `context_loaded`: two registered sources, a 249-row document record
    table, a 56,822-row SQLite table with 74 columns, about 20k document chars, and the latest stage
    was `databao_ask` after roughly 73s of context loading. This points at hard stability/context
    payload cost rather than final guard or postprocess swallowing an existing prediction.
  - Follow-up profiling found the main local bottleneck was not SQLite loading itself. The expensive
    step was `infer_answer_contract()`, which repeatedly called metric-column detection over full
    object columns. On `task_420`, contract inference dropped from about `70.3s` to `2.9s` after
    changing metric-column profiling to use numeric dtype checks plus a bounded non-null sample for
    object columns.
  - `20260511T054345Z` targeted `task_420` after the profiling fix succeeded and wrote a prediction.
    `context_load` dropped to `4.599s`; `databao_ask` took `117.847s`; total runtime was `128.895s`.
    Evaluator score remained `0.0`, so the fix addresses hard missing-prediction stability, not
    answer semantics.
  - Full sweep after the profiling fix:
    - Easy `20260511T054812Z`: prediction `15/15`, exact `9/15`, avg `0.667`.
    - Medium `20260511T055505Z`: prediction `23/23`, exact `14/23`, avg `0.641`.
    - Hard `20260511T060405Z`: prediction `9/11`, exact `0/11`, avg `0.045`.
    - `task_420` wrote a prediction in the hard sweep with `context_load=4.555s`; the remaining
      missing predictions were `task_352` (`GraphRecursionError`, 50 LLM calls) and `task_355`
      (Databao returned no dataframe after 50 calls / `127.168s` ask time). This suggests the next
      hard-stability target is Databao recursion/no-output behavior on small doc+table contexts, not
      local schema profiling.
  - Targeted answer-shape cleanup after comparing `20260507` vs `20260511` runs:
    - Count questions now prefer existing count-like answer columns over entity/filter evidence
      columns. `task_24` targeted run `20260511T065037Z` returned `attendance_count=17` and scored
      exact.
    - Column-only compaction now protects schema-backed expected columns in multi-attribute answers.
      `task_415` targeted run `20260511T064937Z` preserved `url,constructorRef` and scored exact.
    - `task_350` targeted run `20260511T065105Z` returned `count=7` and scored exact, but this was
      Databao returning a better candidate rather than a new deterministic counting fallback.
  - Full sweep after count/multi-attribute cleanup:
    - Easy `20260511T065626Z`: prediction `15/15`, exact `11/15`, avg `0.767`.
    - Medium `20260511T070308Z`: prediction `22/23`, exact `15/23`, avg `0.674`; the only missing
      task was `task_180`, caused by Databao `GraphRecursionError` after 50 LLM calls.
    - Hard `20260511T071557Z`: prediction `8/11`, exact `3/11`, avg `0.273`; missing tasks were
      `task_349`, `task_352`, and `task_420`, all Databao `GraphRecursionError` after 50 LLM calls.
      The average recovered to the older high hard baseline, but prediction-written stability is
      still worse than desired.

## 2026-05-14 High-Score Restore Decision

The branch was restored to the previously saved high-scoring `databao_demo.py` from
`C:\Users\tianj\Downloads\databao_demo.py` instead of continuing the conservative cleanup branch.
The restored file differs from the smaller baseline in one important way: Databao uses
`DATABAO_EXECUTOR_TYPE=lighthouse_salvage` by default. This executor keeps the latest successful
Databao/Lighthouse DataFrame when the agent fails to submit a final result, records the generated
code and submit/salvage flags on `frame.attrs`, and lets the normal Databao-first ranking path use
that salvaged table.

Temporary validation with the downloaded file before committing:

| Difficulty | Run id | Prediction | Exact | Avg |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| easy | `20260513T153200Z` | `15/15` | `10/15` | `0.713` |
| medium | `20260513T153634Z` | `23/23` | `13/23` | `0.570` |
| hard | `20260513T154923Z` | `11/11` | `6/11` | `0.545` |

This result makes the tradeoff clear. The conservative branch kept the runner cleaner, but it lost
the most valuable hard-stability mechanism. The restored high-score version is less minimal because
it contains salvaged-result compactors and repair candidates, but those are tied to Databao's own
latest execution state rather than broad pre-Databao synthetic guessing. For the current goal, the
salvage path is worth keeping as the mainline.

The immediately preceding conservative branch is recorded as a negative experiment:

- Answer-focus column targeting, uppercase camel-case ID suppression, `Diagnosis`/`disease` aliasing,
  and duplicate answer-row removal were small, generic-looking fixes.
- Targeted `task_180` showed the ID-helper cleanup worked, but Databao still selected one extra
  semantic source row; the fix did not address the real failure source.
- Full checks on that branch produced easy `20260513T080952Z` avg `0.676`, exact `9/15`,
  prediction `15/15`; medium `20260513T081454Z` avg `0.576`, exact `13/23`, prediction `22/23`.
- Those changes should not be treated as active mainline behavior. If revisited, they should be
  reintroduced one at a time behind targeted ablation, not mixed into the restored salvage baseline.

## 2026-05-14 Easy Safe Cleanup

After restoring the salvage runner, the first easy-focused cleanup stayed inside deterministic
answer shaping rather than Databao prompt/planner changes:

- Entity display lookup now prefers stable display/name/title/label columns before status/category
  columns. This lets context superlative verification return event names instead of status values.
- Answer-column pruning now uses the leading answer phrase as a signal, so questions such as
  "provide the eye colour", "what is his number", and "what is the finish time" prefer the requested
  attribute over filter/sort/helper columns.
- Superlative metric columns are treated as sort evidence unless the question explicitly asks for
  the metric value. Context superlative candidates with strong metric evidence and tied rows can
  beat a single-row Databao candidate.

Targeted checks:

- `task_25` run `20260513T162452Z`: exact, repaired lowest-cost ties to three event names.
- `task_74` run `20260513T162519Z`: exact, selected `eye_colour`.
- `task_80` run `20260513T162857Z`: exact, selected only `number`.
- `task_89` run `20260513T162804Z`: column shape fixed to `time`, but Databao selected the wrong
  source row; this is a semantic filtering issue and was not forced by the guard.

Full easy check:

- `20260513T163105Z`: prediction `15/15`, exact `11/15`, avg `0.733`.
- Remaining easy misses should be treated as Databao semantic/source-row errors or run variance, not
  as safe final-guard targets.

## 2026-05-14 Medium Adapter Repair

The next adapter-only pass focused on cases where Databao already produced a filtered/detail table
or a nearly final identifier answer. It did not modify Databao internals, restore planner/finalizer,
or add task/domain/file-stem rules.

Changes:

- Databao generated code is parsed into a lightweight `sql_observation` diagnostic with operation
  flags for select, filter, join, group-by, aggregate, ratio, order-by, and limit.
- A narrow `databao_observed_detail_aggregate_compaction` verifier can turn Databao's own filtered
  detail table into a count or average candidate. It only fires when the SQL/code evidence shows
  filter/group/join work has already happened, and it is ranked like any other candidate.
- Count compaction now prefers distinct ID/display values when available, avoiding duplicate detail
  rows in count questions.
- Explicit identifier answers prefer primary/short identifier columns over helper relation IDs such
  as accepted/owner/editor/parent variants unless those helper roles are explicitly requested.

Targeted results:

- `task_145` run `20260513T165205Z`: exact. Databao returned filtered meeting detail; the adapter
  counted the rows.
- `task_196` run `20260513T165241Z`: exact. Databao returned per-atom bond counts; the adapter
  averaged the metric.
- `task_250` run `20260513T165425Z`: exact. The adapter selected `Id` rather than a helper answer id.
- `task_214` run `20260513T165305Z`: still wrong because Databao's filtered detail table contained
  the wrong population. This remains a source/filter semantics issue, not a safe adapter repair.

Full sweep after this pass:

- Easy `20260513T165623Z`: prediction `14/15`, exact `11/15`, avg `0.767`; `task_80` timed out with
  no prediction in this run, while previous targeted `task_80` run `20260513T162857Z` was exact.
- Medium `20260513T170308Z`: prediction `23/23`, exact `15/23`, avg `0.685`.

This is the current best evidence that the adapter can safely improve medium when it completes an
operation that Databao has already partially executed. It should not be broadened into arbitrary
context recomputation.

## 2026-05-14 Hard Salvage Report

Using hard run `20260513T154923Z` after restoring `lighthouse_salvage`:

- Overall: prediction `11/11`, exact `6/11`, avg `0.545`.
- The remaining wrong tasks split into two groups.

Adapter-safe candidates:

- `task_344`: Databao returned a filtered detail table with `ID, FG, SEX, WBC` and SQL already
  applied sex/WBC/FG filters. The question asks "how many". This is the same pattern as the medium
  observed-detail aggregate repair: count distinct IDs from a filtered detail table.
- `task_408`: Databao returned ordered race-result detail for the requested race with `position`,
  `time`, `milliseconds`, and `fastestLapTime`. The question asks a percentage speed/time delta
  between champion and last finisher. This is a possible narrow rank-delta/time-percentage repair,
  but it needs careful evidence checks because missing `milliseconds` values and `+delta` time
  notation can make the arithmetic brittle.

Not adapter-safe without deeper Databao/context changes:

- `task_355`: Databao salvaged a document-record lookup by ID and returned prose metadata such as
  `asset registered under`, not the expense/member/cost row. The issue is source selection and
  document materialization quality.
- `task_379`: Databao selected six molecule IDs and returned 4th atom elements, but gold has seven
  target elements. The candidate is shape-correct but source population is wrong.
- `task_396`: Databao queried document records by a list of names and returned `height` blanks,
  while the gold asks for a publisher percentage over height-filtered heroes. This is source
  population and document/table relation reasoning, not safe final-guard work.

Next hard experiments should therefore be:

1. Extend `databao_observed_detail_aggregate_compaction` to count distinct IDs for filtered detail
   tables when the SQL observation shows filtering/join evidence. This should target `task_344`
   without touching Databao internals.
2. Prototype a shadow-only `rank_delta_percentage` observation for ordered detail tables with
   complete first/last timing evidence. Only promote it if arithmetic evidence is explicit.
3. For `task_355/379/396`, inspect Databao internals or context registration. These should not be
   fixed with generic final-guard pruning because the returned rows are semantically wrong.

Follow-up targeted checks:

- `task_344` run `20260513T173041Z`: Databao returned a scalar `count=0`, not a filtered detail
  table. Its SQL inferred normal ranges via mean/stddev. The adapter cannot safely change this to
  the gold count without external threshold evidence, so this task moves from "adapter-safe" to
  "Databao/context semantics" for runs with scalar output. The distinct-ID count compactor still
  covers future runs where Databao returns filtered detail rows.
- `task_408` run `20260513T173249Z`: Databao queried `position <= 5 ORDER BY raceId, position
  LIMIT 50`, without constraining the requested race/year or producing first/last timing evidence.
  A rank-delta percentage repair would be unsafe on this candidate. Keep it as a Databao/source
  selection issue until the executor exposes a more relevant intermediate table.

## 2026-05-14 Adapter-Safe Easy/Medium Pass

This pass kept Databao-first behavior and did not add planner/finalizer/semantic-repair routes.
Only low-risk adapter fixes were applied:

- camelCase ID resolution now rejects conflicting target hints, so `driverId` does not resolve
  through `driverStandingsId` or unrelated same-domain helper tables;
- entity answers prefer strong display columns (`name`, `title`, `label`, `display_name`, URL/text
  family) before weak display-like fields such as ordinal/status text;
- explicit multi-attribute questions keep multiple requested columns before single-column strong
  matches can collapse the answer;
- exact duplicate answer rows are removed after postprocess;
- already-aggregated one-row multi-metric Databao SQL outputs are not compacted into a single
  average column.

Targeted checks:

- `task_86` run `20260514T021249Z`: exact, output race `name` column with all 16 rows.
- `task_249` run `20260514T014927Z`: exact, preserved both `avg_upvotes` and `avg_age`.
- `task_199` run `20260514T014834Z`: still wrong in this run because Databao selected the wrong
  school population; duplicate-row cleanup is not enough to repair source semantics.

Full sweeps after this pass:

- Easy `20260514T021353Z`: prediction `15/15`, exact `12/15`, avg `0.800`.
  - `task_86` had the right `name` column but Databao included one extra source row in this full
    run, so the remaining error is source/filter semantics rather than final-column selection.
- Medium `20260514T015641Z`: prediction `23/23`, exact `14/23`, avg `0.641`.
  - This run was lower than the prior `20260513T170308Z` medium run mostly due to Databao semantic
    variance (`task_200`, `task_243`) while `task_249` improved from `0.5` to exact.
- Hard `20260514T022038Z`: prediction `10/11`, exact `4/11`, avg `0.364`.

Current conclusion: these adapter fixes are worth keeping because they are schema/column-name
generic, improve easy/hard stability, and do not introduce public-task domains. Remaining easy and
medium failures are mostly Databao source/filter/operation mistakes, not safe final-guard work.

## 2026-05-14 Databao Internal Observation Shadow Mode

The remaining easy/medium failures increasingly require observing Databao's own execution path
rather than adding final-answer patches. A shadow-only diagnostic layer was added:

- `databao_internal_observation` is written to each task log after Databao returns a frame.
- It records whether the frame is `databao_final` or `databao_salvaged_intermediate`, submit status,
  executor type, output shape, SQL/code operation flags, column families, risk flags, and shadow
  recommendations.
- It does not generate candidates, change ranking, prune columns, or trigger rescue.

Targeted validation:

- `task_243` run `20260514T032735Z`: prediction remained wrong (`post_count`), but the log now
  records `ratio_question_without_ratio_operation` and recommends checking numerator/denominator
  evidence. This is the desired behavior for Phase 1 observation: expose why Databao's submitted
  result is incomplete without changing the answer.

Next use:

- Run easy/medium misses and collect `databao_internal_observation.risk_flags`.
- Promote a repair only when the Databao trace proves enough operation evidence, for example a
  filtered detail table for count/aggregate or complete numerator/denominator for ratio.

## Diagnostics

Each task log records:

- `heuristic_level`
- retrieved context summary
- task complexity profile
- context payload profile and Databao failure type
- Databao internal observation shadow diagnostics
- candidate list and candidate scores
- selected candidate source
- `prediction_written`, `scorable`, and missing-prediction status
- answer contract report before/after final guard
- route policy
- postprocess and final answer guard transformations
- timeout budget state
- document extraction usage
- safe LLM call metadata

Raw prompts/responses are not written by default. Set `DATABAO_DEBUG_LOG_RAW=1` to write redacted
raw files under `logs/raw/task_<id>/`.

## Useful Commands

No-API verification:

```powershell
uv run python -m unittest discover tests
uv run --extra dev ruff check src tests
uv run python -m compileall src
```

Local smoke run:

```powershell
uv run dabench run-databao-demo --config configs/react_baseline.local.yaml --limit 1
```

Local public-run evaluation after a run:

```powershell
uv run dabench evaluate-public-run artifacts/databao-demo/<run_id>
```

The evaluator now prints per-task diagnostics including whether a prediction was written, artifact
success, matched/gold/predicted/extra columns, row counts, exact-no-extra status, and an estimated
per-task score. It also surfaces selected candidate source, final-guard removed columns, and
postprocess transformation names so shape/semantic failures can be traced without reading every task
log. Aggregate coverage is kept as debugging context rather than the only score signal.

## Latest Verification

- `uv run python -m unittest discover tests`: 93 tests OK.
- `uv run --extra dev ruff check src tests`: passed.
- `uv run python -m compileall src`: passed.
- `src/` banned public-domain memory term scan: no violations.

## Databao Internal Patch Note

On 2026-05-14 we started moving the next improvement layer into the local Databao clone rather than
adding more adapter-side candidate heuristics. The first patch is a graph-state salvage fix:

- Clone path: `D:\Data\_external\databao-agent`.
- Patched files:
  - `databao/agent/executors/lighthouse/graph.py`
  - `databao/agent/executors/separate/graph.py`
- Behavior: Databao tracks the latest non-empty SQL result. If the model later runs an empty query
  or stops without `submit_result`, Databao can return the previous non-empty result with metadata
  `salvaged_previous_non_empty_result=True`.
- This is intentionally an internal Databao execution-state fix, not an adapter rewrite and not a
  public-task heuristic.

Editable install note: `uv pip install -e D:\Data\_external\databao-agent` currently fails because
the Databao build hook requires `pnpm` for frontend assets. For local validation, the two patched
Python files were copied into `.venv\Lib\site-packages\databao\agent\executors\...`. If this patch
becomes part of the project path, either install `pnpm` and use editable mode or add a clean local
dependency workflow.

Validation:

- Targeted runs:
  - `task_352` run `20260514T044746Z`: exact, `salvaged_previous_non_empty_result=True`.
  - `task_420` run `20260514T044921Z`: exact, `salvaged_previous_non_empty_result=True`.
- Hard sweep:
  - `20260514T045138Z`: prediction `9/11`, exact `4/11`, average `0.382`.
  - This improves on the referenced hard baseline `8/11`, exact `3/11`, average `0.273`.

Open follow-up:

- Run easy/medium regression with the patched Databao package before declaring it safe for the
  mainline.
- Investigate `task_355` timeout inside Databao; `task_415` in the latest hard sweep failed due to
  OpenRouter key limit, not code behavior.

## Databao Submit Critique Research

The local Databao clone now also has an internal submit-critique hook:

- Env: `DATABAO_INTERNAL_SUBMIT_CRITIQUE_MODE=off|shadow|reject`.
- Default: `shadow`.
- Scope: Databao graph only, not the starter-kit adapter.
- It records generic submit risks such as empty result, ratio/percentage without ratio evidence,
  detail rows for aggregate questions, count questions without count-like output, unordered `LIMIT`,
  and wide non-list submissions.

Targeted research:

- `task_408` shadow run `20260514T055942Z`: correctly flagged a percentage question submitted as
  detail rows without ratio evidence.
- `task_408` reject run `20260514T060255Z`: Databao revised into a scalar percentage answer, but the
  value was still wrong because the underlying race/entity grounding was wrong.
- `task_344` reject run `20260514T060543Z`: Databao revised into a count-like answer, but the count
  was still wrong because the filter/value grounding was wrong.

Conclusion: submit critique is useful as an internal diagnostic and possibly a targeted operation
shape gate, but it is not enough to fix grounding errors. Keep global behavior at `shadow`; do not
enable `reject` by default without easy/medium/hard ablation.

Grounding follow-up:

- The local Databao clone now also records shadow-only grounding flags for SQL equality filters that
  use numeric IDs/codes not directly present in the user question.
- Targeted runs:
  - `task_11` run `20260514T062057Z`: flagged `Thrombosis = 3` as
    `numeric_code_filter_needs_value_grounding`.
  - `task_89` run `20260514T062112Z`: flagged `raceId = 34` as
    `numeric_identifier_filter_needs_grounding`.
  - `task_408` run `20260514T062254Z`: still hit `GraphRecursionError` before submit, so submit-only
    critique did not run.
- Decision: grounding flags remain diagnostics only. They explain wrong ID/code filters, but they
  should not become reject conditions until Databao has a grounded lookup/validation loop and
  targeted ablations show no easy/medium regression.
- A small grounding-reject targeted ablation did not produce reliable gains, so the reject path stays
  off. The signal was tightened instead: generic ordinal/ranking phrases now count as numeric
  evidence, which avoids false positives for filters like `position = 2` when the question says
  "second".

No-submit diagnostics follow-up:

- Databao now appends a no-submit critique when it returns or salvages an intermediate SQL result
  without a `submit_result` call.
- Targeted runs:
  - `task_352` run `20260514T063034Z`: exact, `databao_salvaged_intermediate`, critique included
    `no_submit_result`.
  - `task_420` run `20260514T063146Z`: exact, `databao_salvaged_intermediate`, critique included
    `no_submit_result` and `ratio_question_without_ratio_evidence`.
- Decision: keep this as diagnostics. It makes no-submit salvage explainable without turning the
  adapter into a new rescue system.

Graph-recursion salvage follow-up:

- The Lighthouse salvage executor now returns the last streamed graph state when GraphRecursionError
  happens after Databao has produced either `df` or `last_non_empty_df`.
- `task_408` run `20260514T063751Z`: prediction was written instead of missing. The score was still
  `0.000`; submit critique flagged ungrounded `raceId = 28` and incomplete ratio evidence. This
  confirms the fix is stability/observability only. Correctness needs a later grounded ID/code
  validation loop inside Databao.

Task 355 investigation:

- `task_355` now has enough checkpoints to localize its missing-prediction failure.
- Single-task reruns `20260514T093917Z`, `20260514T094344Z`, and `20260514T095049Z` all timed out
  before prediction.
- The latest progress reaches Databao source initialization, system prompt rendering, execution core
  start, graph stream start, and the initial graph state. It then stalls before any Databao chat
  callback is recorded.
- Lowering `DATABAO_DATABAO_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` to `30` did not force an earlier exception, so the
  configured LLM timeout is not a reliable guard for this hang.
- A Databao retry-attempt experiment did not help and was reverted.
- Likely next fix: a real ask-stage watchdog/process boundary plus, separately, a generic
  structured-table anchored lookup path for cases where no Databao frame is produced.

Ask-stage watchdog experiment:

- `DATABAO_ASK_STAGE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=75` was tested on `task_355` in run `20260514T095903Z`.
- Result: prediction was written in `27.5s`, so the process boundary can avoid the parent task
  hanging in `thread.ask`.
- Score remained `0.000`; Databao returned broad expense rows matching any item word instead of the
  single full-phrase row plus linked member name.
- Keep this watchdog default-off until it receives the same retrieval/context settings as the parent
  process and passes easy/medium/hard ablation. It is a stability tool, not a semantic fix.

Anchored lookup critique experiment:

- The local Databao clone now records generic anchored-lookup submit critique flags:
  `disjunctive_text_filter_needs_anchored_match` and `linked_identifier_needs_display_lookup`.
- The former anchored-lookup reject switch was removed. Anchored lookup now stays diagnostics-only,
  so it cannot accidentally reject a hidden-set partial answer.
- Targeted `task_355` runs were mixed:
  - `20260514T100545Z`: score `0.250`; correct expense/cost row, but still missing the member name.
  - `20260514T101239Z`: score `0.000`; two rejections pushed Databao to a bad document-record row,
    so that extra rejection behavior was reverted.
  - `20260514T101511Z`: score `0.000`; adding concrete link-value hints made the diagnostic clearer
    but did not reliably fix the answer.
- Decision: keep anchored lookup as Databao-internal diagnostics only. Do not enable anchored reject
  globally. The next real scoring path should be a grounded lookup executor or a better generic
  document-record extractor, not more critique wording.

High-yield generic cleanup follow-up:

- Instead of continuing to tune `task_355`, the next patch targeted a broader score leak:
  answer tables that already contain the correct value but also include all-blank columns or duplicate
  same-family columns.
- Generic document extraction was improved so paragraphs with forms such as
  `record/id ... is/identified as/corresponds to ...` can populate the display `name` for a
  `record_id`. This is domain-agnostic and helps `link_to_*` / document lookup workflows.
- `final_answer_shape_guard()` now removes:
  - columns whose values are all blank when at least one nonblank answer column remains;
  - duplicate same-family columns such as `name` / `name_2` when their normalized values are
    identical.
- Targeted validation:
  - `task_349` run `20260514T102859Z`: exact, score `1.000`; previous targeted run had the correct
    value plus four extra blank/duplicate columns and scored `0.200`.
  - `task_200` run `20260514T103200Z`: exact, score `1.000`.
  - `task_257` run `20260514T103243Z`: still partial (`0.500`) because Databao returned only the
    display name and not the requested metric; this is a Databao source/output selection issue, not
    a guard issue.
- Full sweeps after the patch:
  - Easy `20260514T103419Z`: prediction `15/15`, exact `12/15`, avg `0.800`.
  - Medium `20260514T103857Z`: prediction `23/23`, exact `17/23`, avg `0.739`.
  - Hard `20260514T105041Z`: prediction `11/11`, exact `6/11`, avg `0.545`.
- Decision: keep this patch. It is the best recent score/complexity tradeoff: broad enough to help
  multiple tasks, but conservative enough to avoid source-row semantic rewrites.

Vendored Databao patch:

- The modified Databao graph files are now stored inside this repository under
  `src/data_agent_baseline/_vendor/databao_patches/`.
- `build_databao_agent()` and the Lighthouse salvage executor call `ensure_vendor_databao_patches()`
  before importing/constructing Databao internals. The function copies the vendored graph files into
  the active installed `databao` package when they differ.
- Default behavior is to apply these patches. Set `DATABAO_APPLY_VENDOR_PATCHES=0` only for
  debugging against the unmodified upstream PyPI package.
- This makes a fresh checkout reproduce the local Databao behavior without manually copying files
  into `.venv`.

Reverted volatile-task adapter stabilization experiment:

- A small adapter-side stabilization pass was tested for cases where Databao already returns a useful
  detail table but the final answer shape is unstable. It included generic ordinal/rank filtering,
  superlative row filtering, stronger answer-attribute focus, varying-record-ID preference, and a
  guard against aggregate compaction overriding superlative attribute lookups.
- Targeted checks:
  - `task_38` run `20260517T090149Z`: exact; the adapter selected `trans_id` rather than the constant
    filtering `client_id`.
  - `task_89` run `20260517T090214Z`: exact; the rank filter selected the row with the requested
    ordinal rank when Databao exposed a rank-like column.
  - `task_218` run `20260517T090659Z`: exact; the answer-column verifier selected `Phone` for
    "telephone number".
  - `task_196` run `20260517T090236Z`: still not exact; Databao's submitted SQL already computed the
    wrong scalar formula, which this adapter pass should not try to repair.
- Full sweep after the pass:
  - Easy `20260517T090743Z`: prediction `15/15`, exact `12/15`, avg `0.800`.
  - Medium `20260517T091101Z`: prediction `23/23`, exact `14/23`, avg `0.630`.
  - Hard `20260517T091813Z`: prediction `11/11`, exact `6/11`, avg `0.545`.
- Decision: reverted from active code. The targeted shape fixes were real, but the full sweep was
  below the recent high-score baseline. The remaining failures are better explained by Databao SQL/path
  variance: `task_80` salvaged a no-submit `q3` detail result, `task_330` returned the right score
  columns but lacked enough match filters, and `task_344` submitted a wrong scalar count. These should
  be handled inside Databao grounding/no-submit behavior, not by broad adapter rescue.

Databao-internal volatility stabilization:

- Implemented a Databao-internal no-submit finality retry in the vendored Lighthouse/Separate graph
  patches. If the final AI message does not call `submit_result` but a DataFrame exists, Databao adds
  one internal feedback message asking the model to either submit the latest query or run one corrected
  SELECT and then submit. This is capped at one retry by `DATABAO_INTERNAL_NO_SUBMIT_FINALITY_MAX_RETRIES`
  and can be disabled with `DATABAO_INTERNAL_NO_SUBMIT_FINALITY_RETRY=0`.
- Internal feedback messages are ignored by `_latest_user_question()` so submit critiques continue to
  use the original benchmark question, not the retry instruction. The feedback also avoids replaying
  potentially misleading critique suggestions such as count hints.
- The no-submit feedback now includes generic execution evidence: latest result shape, column names,
  SQL text, and up to two sample rows. This keeps the repair inside Databao's tool loop and helps the
  model choose between submitting the current query and running one corrected SELECT without adding
  adapter-side semantic candidates.
- Added a narrow P0 submit critique for time precision mismatch: when the question gives a time only
  to whole-second precision but SQL uses equality against a fractional-second literal, Databao rejects
  the submit once and asks for a prefix/range/truncation match that includes all rows in that second.
- Tightened `blank_display_needs_join`: if the submitted result already contains a non-ID attribute
  column explicitly requested by the question, Databao no longer forces a display/name join merely
  because the wording contains "who/person/etc.".
- Targeted validation:
  - `task_80` run `20260517T101401Z`: exact. The first useful query containing `driverId, q3, number`
    was no longer wrongly rejected for missing display/name, and the time-granularity critique can
    recover from over-precise fractional-second equality filters.
  - Guard tasks `task_38`, `task_214`, `task_218`, `task_250`, `task_257`, and `task_330` all scored
    exact in targeted runs `20260517T101505Z` through `20260517T101731Z`.
  - `task_344` remains unresolved; the failure is Databao choosing a different threshold/count formula,
    not a no-submit/finality issue.
- Full sweep after this Databao-internal patch:
  - Easy `20260517T101958Z`: prediction `15/15`, exact `13/15`, avg `0.867`.
  - Medium `20260517T102258Z`: prediction `23/23`, exact `17/23`, avg `0.761`.
  - Hard `20260517T103126Z`: prediction `11/11`, exact `6/11`, avg `0.606`.
- Interpretation: this is the right layer for stabilizing no-submit and time-granularity failures.
  It improves/maintains easy and medium in this sweep. Hard still varies because remaining misses are
  mostly Databao grounding/formula choices (`task_344`, `task_355`) rather than finality mechanics.
- Follow-up rejected experiment: a submit-time numeric scale / multi-level condition critique was
  tried for `task_344` after observing SQL filters such as `FG < 200 OR FG > 400` against a column
  whose observed values are roughly tens. Targeted run `20260517T122016Z` showed the critique could
  push Databao to use observed min/max values as semantic thresholds, still scoring `0.000`; the
  follow-up run `20260517T122814Z` also stayed `0.000` after removing that path. The lesson is that
  formula/threshold grounding needs documentation-grounded reasoning inside Databao, not a generic
  min/max rejection rule.
